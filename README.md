## Challenge & Solution

The To Do app is a joint venture with one of my Coder Academy co-students in one of our first foray's into collaborative working.
We utilised a number of different platforms and methodologies in this experience - some of which are;
- AGILE: Daily standups
- Trello: Here's a [link](https://trello.com/b/7eIe7mbS/todos-app) to our board 
- Discord: messaging and calls to keep up to date with each other
- git and GitHub: using branches and the push/pull merging system

## Functionality/Features

- Sign up to be able to create your own personalised to do list, and login for returning members with authentication provided by Devise
- Ability to add a new item with title and description and ability to note as "completed" or not.
- Ability to create a new "to do" as well as update and delete previously created items. 

## User Stories
